## 🛑 The "I Told You So" Repository / Guide Catalog

This repository serves as a **centralized catalog of self-written and verified guides** for key technical tools.

**Goal:** To make information on **Git, GitHub, GitLab, Conda**, and other essential tools available 24/7. The creation of this repository was driven by the fact that I (and probably others) got tired of answering the same monotonous questions about working with `git` and similar tools.
